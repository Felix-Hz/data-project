# 👋 Welcome to my Imports Analysis Data Project!

### If you want to know everything about imports of tariff codes 283525, 283526, 310430 and 230990 in Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay and more countries, you're in the right place! I've worked hard to clean and standardize over 150 databases to analyze the data that was collected over the past 10 years.

🧹 With data wrangling, I've made sure the data is squeaky clean and standardized for analysis. On that note, I've used my skills to perform statistical analysis of price behavior, total volume per country and per origin, top 3 importers for each country on each year and more. This was done on data over time using various techniques, and APIs (including gspread) to create an automated report in Google Sheets!

📈 My analysis is presented in a professional and organized manner, with modularized code that is clean and easy to follow. Each module has functions that take care of specific tasks, with descriptive documentation of their nature, arguments, and outputs.

So, buckle up and join me on this data-driven adventure! ⚡️
