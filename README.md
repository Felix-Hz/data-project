# Prototype of an Imports Analysis from Customs Data Project with Python

This project provides an Imports Analysis from Customs Data in Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay and more countries for the tariff codes `283525`, `283526`, `310430`, and `230990`. Over 150 databases were cleaned and standardized for analysis using Jupyter Notebooks and Python. Statistical analysis of price behavior, total volume per country and per origin, top 3 importers for each country on each year, and more was performed using various techniques and APIs (`gspread`). With the use of `export_API.py` in *general_utils* an automated report was created in Google Sheets. The modularized code is clean and easy to follow with descriptive documentation of each module's functions, arguments, and outputs. All of these aspects, enable the presentation of the code in a professional, easy to read and organized manner.
