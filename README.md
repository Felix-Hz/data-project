# Prototype of an Imports Analysis from Customs Data Project with Python

<<<<<<< HEAD
### If you want to know everything about imports of tariff codes `283525`, `283526`, `310430` and `230990` in Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay and more countries, you're in the right place! I've worked hard to clean and standardize over 150 databases to analyze the data that was collected over the past 10 years with Jupyter Notebooks, and Python. 

🧹 With data wrangling, I've made sure the data is squeaky clean and standardized for analysis. On that note, I've used my skills to perform statistical analysis of price behavior, total volume per country and per origin, top 3 importers for each country on each year, and more. This was done on data over time using various techniques, and APIs (`gspread`) to create an automated report in Google Sheets!

📈 My analysis is presented in a professional and organized manner, with *_modularized_* code that is clean and easy to follow. Each module has functions that take care of specific tasks, with descriptive documentation of their nature, arguments, and outputs.

So, buckle up and join me on this data-driven adventure! ⚡️



=======
This project provides an Imports Analysis from Customs Data in Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay and more countries for the tariff codes `283525`, `283526`, `310430`, and `230990`. Over 150 databases were cleaned and standardized for analysis using Jupyter Notebooks and Python. Statistical analysis of price behavior, total volume per country and per origin, top 3 importers for each country on each year, and more was performed using various techniques and APIs (`gspread`). With the use of `export_API.py` in *general_utils* an automated report was created in Google Sheets. The modularized code is clean and easy to follow with descriptive documentation of each module's functions, arguments, and outputs. All of these aspects, enable the presentation of the code in a professional, easy to read and organized manner.
